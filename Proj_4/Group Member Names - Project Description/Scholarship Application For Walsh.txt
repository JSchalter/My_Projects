I believe that education is important not only for myself, but also to set a good example for my children and to provide them with the best possible life. Earning a Walsh scholarship would allow me to continue my pursuit of a bachelor's degree in computer science while also affording the luxury of focusing on my academics without being overly stressed about the day-to-day stress that comes with being a full-time adult student with children. I work part-time as an academic tutor in CIS for Oakland Community College, and it would be ideal if I could keep that position for as long as possible; however, my position as a tutor can be inconsistent at times because pupils only require assistance when they are struggling. I believe that my role as a tutor is critical to both my development as a computer scientist and the students I educate and support during the semester. Earning a scholarship at Walsh would mean the world to me since it would fund my studies while also allowing me to continue to share my knowledge with other students in need.

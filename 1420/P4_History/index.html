    Harington’s family were old friends of Elizabeth and the queen was Harington’s godmother. She seems to have been fond of him, but he was often in trouble for circulating lewd verses and translations among the court ladies. He won his knighthood for military service in Ireland in the 1590s and later for a time acted as a tutor to James I’s son Henry, Prince of Wales. He was 51 when he died at Kelston. His flush toilet did not catch on and serious improvement of lavatories in England had to wait for the 18th century and the coming of the S-bend.    </p>
